<h1>Technical Documentation Page</h1>

<p>For my third solo project on Freecodecamp, I had the task of making a Technical Documentation Page. I chose to do my page about Git. I chose this topic because I am currently learning how to use Git. Through the making of the page I was able to better understand  Git.</p>

<p>Similar to past projects,  there were code and features I had to incorporate into my Technical Documentation Page.</p>
